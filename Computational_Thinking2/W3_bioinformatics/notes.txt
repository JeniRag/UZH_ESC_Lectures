The problem for this week and next week is in two parts. Collaborative
solutions are encouraged.

The first part is a graphical way of comparing similar but not
identical strings.  You are asked to write a function like

def dots(a,b,W):
    # code here...
    return x,y

where a and b are strings, W is the window size, and x and y are lists
(or arrays) of points.  In particular

    dots('My care is loss of care, by old care done',
         'Your care is gain of care, by new care won,5)

leads to the dotplot.png figure. The comparison is to be done using a
dictionary or other hash-table method.

The second part is application to real genes, to construct a
phylogenetic tree.  A good source is www.uniprot.org which is the
Swiss archive of protein sequences.  The fetch.py script fetches
protein sequences for genes from that site.  The cryptic names refer
to one particular gene (ATP synthase subunit a) in several different
species (human, ostrich, python, and so on).  Genbank and Fasta are
two text-file formats, which you will be able to figure out.

Now have fun and reconstruct some evolution history.  For example,
among African and Asian elephants and mammoths, which branched first?
